The following commands will have to be run before the project can be served.

1. npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular

(Note: Numbering is NOT a part of the command. Eg. if the command in the list is written as "1. npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular", the command run would be "npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular", without the quotes.)
